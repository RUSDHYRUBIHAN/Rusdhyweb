            POEM OF THE DAY
 And the Word for Moonlight Is My Name
BY JAI HAMID BASHIR
Hello.
                                                          Chandini.

This mouth is a wound from where I’m learning
                how to love. My love language, I’ve told strange men, is words
                            of   affirmation. In naked brag of my American tongue—

how does it taste to love with this Indian body? I knew love...
